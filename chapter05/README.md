# Chapter 05. Node and the Web  

## The HTTP Module: Server and Client  
+ it's low-level, focusing on stream handling and message parsing   
+ two parameters in the callback for the request event: `request` and `response`  

### Request  
+ an instance of the `IncomingMessage` class, which is a readable stream  
+ some accessible information are  

field         | description
-------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------
`headers`     | The request/response header objects
`httpVersion` | HTTP request version
`method`      | Only for a `http.Server` request, and returns HTTP verb (`GET` or `POST`)
`rawHeaders`  | Raw headers
`rawTrailers` | Raw trailers

### Response  
+ an object of type `http.ServerReponse`  
+ a writable stream with support for several functions as    

function      | description
-------------:|:---------------------------
`writeHead()` | creates the response header  
`write()`     | writes the response data  
`end()`       | ends the response  

### A simple C/S model  
+ instantiate a `ClientRequest` class by the `http.request()` function in the client side  
+ the application listens for one or more `data` events, which it uses to get chunks of data in the request. The application continues getting chunks until it receives an `end` event on the request object  
+ If the application is making a lot of requests, they can get bottlenecked because of the limited pool. The way around this is to disable connection pooling by setting the `agent` to `false` in the outgoing request properties  

(demo as `http/example01.js` for servers and `http/example02.js` for clients)  

## What's Involved in Creating a Static Web Server  
### Steps to Build a Static Web Server  
1. Create an HTTP server and listen for requests.  
2. When a request arrives, parse the request URL to determine the location for the file.  
3. Check to make sure the file exists.  
4. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, respond accordingly.  
5. If the file does exist, open the file for reading.  
6. Prepare a response header.  
7. Write the file to the response.  
8. Wait for the next request.  

### Relevant Functions  
+ `fs.stat()` function returns an error if the file doesn't exist    
+ `fs.readFile()` wants to read the file completely into memory before making it available  
+ `fs.createReadStream()` creates a readable stream for **piping** and automatical ending  
  - two events of interest  
    + `open`: emitted when the stream is ready
    + `error`: if a problem occurs   

(demo as `example03.js`)  

### `Mime` module  
+ **Problem**: the server app with `video` element won't work in IE10  
+ **Solution**: test for the file extension for each file and then return the appropriate MIME type in the response header, where the `Mime` module would come to help  
+ The `Mime` module can return the proper MIME type given a filename (with or without path), and can also return file extensions given a content type (demo as `mime/mime.js`)  
+ shoulde check for both existence and directory   
+ use the core `path` module to normalize the path string so it works in both windows and linux (`path.js`)  

A complete version of a static file server goes as `http2/app.js`  

> In Node, the predefined `__dirname` specifies the current working directory for a Node application.  

## Using Apache to Proxy a Node Application  
+ The **good** is it's extremely simple, and we have a very robust, well-known web server fielding the requests before our Node application gets hit. Apache provides security and other functionality that would be extremely difficult to implement in a Node application.  
+ The **not-so-good** is that Apache spawns a new thread for every request, and there are only so many threads to go around   

## Parsing the Query with Query String  
+ `querystring.parse()` convert a query string to an object (demo as `querystring/parse.js`)   
+ `querystring.stringify()` convert an object as a query string to send (demo as `querystring/stringify.js`)  

## DNS Resolution  
### `dns.lookup()`  
+ used to give the first returned IP address a domain name (demo as `dns/lookup.js`)  
+ parameters for the `callback(err,address,family)` are  
  - The `address` is the returned IP address  
  - the `family` value is either 4 (for IPv4) or 6 (for IPv6)  
+ an allowable `options` go as  
  - `family`: A number, 4 (for IPv4) or 6 (for IPv6)  
  - `hints`: Supported `getaddrinfo` flags, a number  
  - `all`: If `true`, returns all addresses (default is `false`) (demo as `dns/lookup2.js`)  
### `dns.resolve()`  
+ resolves a hostname into record types  
+ The types (as strings) are   

type | description 
----:|:-----------
A     | Default IPv4 address
AAAA  | IPv6 address
MX    | Mail exchange record  
TXT   | Text records
SRV   | SRV records
PTR   | Used for reverse IP lookup 
NS    | Name server
CNAME | Canonical name records
SOA   | Start of authority record

(demo as `dns/resolve.js`)
